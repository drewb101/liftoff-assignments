### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to incorporate the various features into one cohesive website.  I have built a number of the features in previous projects for LC101 but not from scratch or all together.  Also, I need to learn how to incorporate SQL databases with MVC projects as previously we have only used Excel .cvs files as a makeshift database.
